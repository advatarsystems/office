## Introduction

Redefining office and collaboration tools

Basically we want our own loosely coupled Google Docs Apps for mobile with encrypted cloud backup. Each app should be html5/node.js running under a private Cloudfoundry account.

There should be an API to personal data

### Document types

1. text (prose)
2. spreadsheet (convince)
3. slides (pitch)
4. task/worklist/todo list (tick)

### Functional Units

#### Data Storage
1. Mountable
2. Shareable


### Common Functionality

#### Multi author
ala etherpad
#### ActivityStream
Chat
#### EventStream
These are system generated events and should be piped via the native notification functionality of the device
#### ACL
Invite/Share

### Workflow

Starting from a list of known patterns/use cases (use the work from Yawl), can we implement them using the github pull/request workflow?

One general approach could be to go over all those patterns and think about how we would support them (regardless of yawl, bpmn2 or whatever)
